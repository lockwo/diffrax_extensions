# Abstract solvers

All of the solvers (both ODE and SDE solvers) implement the following interface specified by [`diffrax_extensions.AbstractSolver`][].

The exact details of this interface are only really useful if you're using the [Manual stepping](../../usage/manual-stepping.md) interface or defining your own solvers; otherwise this is all just internal to the library.

Also see [Extending Diffrax](../../usage/extending.md) for more information on defining your own solvers.

In addition [`diffrax_extensions.AbstractSolver`][] has several subclasses that you can use to mark your custom solver as exhibiting particular behaviour.
